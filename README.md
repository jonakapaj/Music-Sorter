# Playlist Management System

This project is a robust and user-friendly playlist management system built in Python. It allows users to create, manage, and interact with playlists of songs.

## Features

- **Create Playlists**: Users can create new playlists with unique names.
- **Manage Playlists**: Users can add songs to a playlist, delete songs from a playlist, and display all songs in a playlist.
- **Sort Songs**: Songs in a playlist can be sorted by title or artist, in ascending or descending order.
- **Play Songs**: Users can play the current song, move to the next song, or move to the previous song in a playlist.
- **Search Songs**: Users can search for a song across all playlists.
- **Persistent Storage**: Playlists are saved to a JSON file, so they persist between sessions.
